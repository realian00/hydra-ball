# hydra-ball
Easy and fun game built with JS

The concept of the game started as a JS canvas exerceise proposed by MDN, and started growing into something new. 

Still don't know what will be the end of it...

// next steps - game functionality:

- start with x balls, one is red;
- have x time to click the red
- if clicked on time, reduce one ball from max and render again
- if not clicked, increase one ball in max and render again
- if timeout, game over
- if no balls, win
